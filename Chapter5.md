- Workflow for a server
    - Fill hints:
        - `ai_family = AF_UNSPEC` , IF WE WANT BOTH ipV4 AND iPV6
        - `AI_SOCKTYPE = sock_stream` for TCP
        - `ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE`, so the returned address use a wildcard IP which means any local address the host has.
    - Call `getaddrinfo(NULL, “port-or-servicename”, &hints, &res)`
    - Iterate over the linked list
        - For each node: We can create a socket using the node’s family/type/protocol, attempt to bind() to the nod’s ai_addr/ai_addrlen. If bind fails, close that socket and try the nexxt node.
        - Stop when bind succeeds.
    - `listen()` ,on the socket you successfully bound
    - Later freeaddrinfo(res) to release the list.
- Workflow for a client
    - Fill hints:
        - `ai_family = AF_UNSPEC`
        - `AI_SOCKTYPE = SOCK_STREAM` for TCP
        - Do not set AI-PASSIVE
    - Call `getaddrinfo("hostname-or-ip", "port-or-service", &hints, &res)`
    - Iterate over res
        - For each node: Create a socket with that node’s family/type/protocol, attempt to connect() to ai_addr. If connection fails, close and try the next node.
        - Stop when the connection succeeds.
    - `freeaddrinfo(res)`  when done with the list
